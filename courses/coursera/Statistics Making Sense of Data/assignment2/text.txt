Question 1
We're interested in the prevalence of the A variant of the TNF-alpha gene at position 308.  It is thought that this variant is less common, that is, it occurs in less than half of the population. Carry out an hypothesis test to test this.

In your answer, state:
* Whether you're carrying out a one-sided or two-sided test.
* The value of the test statistic that you calculate.
* Based on the test statistic, whether the P-value is large or small.
* Your conclusion.

ANSWER:

* I would carry an one-sided test, namely I would use a null-hypethesis p(A308) = 0.5 versus an alternative hypothesis p(A308) < 0.5
* Our observed variable is p_hat = 0.3 (table 3)
* The test statistic is (p_hat - p) / sqrt(p * (1 - p) / n), which, given p = 0.5 and n = 110 (table 3), works out to approx -4.195
* Based on the test statistics, we can calculate p-value = P(N(0, 1) <= -4.195) = 1.362942e-05
* The p-value is too small so we reject the null-hypothesis and conclude that the A308 variant occurs less than in the half of the population

Question 2
From our data, we estimate that 28.2% of the population has the A variant at position 238, and 30.0% has the A variant at position 308, where the "population" here is the population that is represented by our subjects.  We're interested in whether the prevalence of the A variant is the same for position 238 and position 308 in this population.  That is, is the proportion of people with the A variant at position 238 the same as the proportion of people with the A variant at position 308?  Using only the information you are given in the pdf document of plots and summary statistics, this test cannot be carried out. Why not?

ANSWER:

This would be a matching pair test, but for carrying it we would need to know the corresponding values of each pair - and we don't know that.

==============================================================

Question 3
Construct a 95% confidence interval for the difference in the proportion of males with the A variant at position 308, and the proportion of females with the A variant at position 308.  State the confidence interval that you calculate.  Based on your confidence interval, is there evidence that the proportion of the A variant at 308 differs between males and females?  You may use the fact that the critical value for a 95% confidence interval from a standard normal distribution is 1.96.

ANSWER:

* From table 5 for males we have pm_hat = 0.228 and nm = 58, and for females pf_hat = 0.310 and nf = 52
* The critical value is 1.96 * sqrt(pm_hat * (1 - pm_hat) / nm + pf_hat * (1 - pf_hat) / nf), which yields cv = 0.1657
* The 95% confidence interval is (pm_hat - pf_hat) +- cv, which works out to [0.0837 -0.2477]
* Based on the confidence interval we may conclude that there is no evidence that the proportion of A308 differs between males and females as the interval includes 0

Question 4
Carry out a statistical test to determine if the mean of HDL is the same for males and females for the population represented by this study.  You should assume that the variance is the same for males and females.  

In your answer, state:
* Whether you're carrying out a one-sided or two-sided test.
* The value of the test statistic that you calculate.
* Based on the test statistic, whether the P-value is large or small.
* Your conclusion.

ANSWER:

* Let X_m denote the observed mean for males and x_f - for females, and mu_m and mu_f - actual means of the population
* Also, let s^2_m and s^2_f denote variance for males and females respectively and nm and nf - the number of males and females
* The null hypothesis is that mu_m does not equal nu_2 versus mu_m equals mu_f
* Assuming that the variance is the same, we can calculate s^2_pooled = [(nm - 1) s^2_m + (nf - 1) s^2_f ] / [nm + nf - 2], which, using table 4, yields 0.06028
* Next, we calculate test statistics [(x_m - x_f) - (mu_m - mu_f)] / sqrt(s^2_m / nm + s^2_f / nf) = -3.7536
* The p-value for the test would be 2* P(|t_df| <= 3.7536)
* As t-distribution becomes closer to N(0, 1) as the number of degrees of freedom grows, we can assume that for df = 108 the z-value is 1.96
* 3.7536 is far from 1.96 and that means that the p-value is small enough to reject the null hypothesis
* And conclude that the true mean of HDL is the same for both males and females

Question 5
It is believed that higher consumption of polyunsaturated fats (PUFA) increases HDL cholesterol levels, but this relationship may be affected by whether or not a subject has the A genetic variant at position 308.  Does this seem to be the case based on the plots and summary statistics you are given?  Investigate this question by examining whether or not there is a relationship between HDL and PUFA, and whether or not that relationship differs between subjects who have and do not have the A variant at position 308.  Support your answer by mentioning relevant plots or summary statistics.  Indicate whether or not you have any concerns about the appropriateness of the analysis of the HDL - PUFA relationship;  that is, might a different type of analysis, or analysis on modified data be more appropriate?

ANSWER:
According to figures 3, 4 and 5, there is no linear relationship between HDL and PUFA, for all subjects, for subject with A308 and for subjects without it. That is supported by the correlation coefficients (table 6), which are near zero for all cases as well as by the results of the linear regression (table 7).

Question 6
In addition to polyunsaturated fats, many different components of diet could be investigated (for example, total calories consumed, and percent of dietary intake from protein, carbohydrates, alcohol, and other types of fat), and many different risk factors of heart disease could be investigated (for example, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, total cholesterol, and C-reactive protein).  So this assignment reflects only one small part of the analysis that was carried out.  How does knowing this affect the implications of the conclusions you made?

ANSWER:

We should pay careful attention to extraneous/confounding variables as they affect the regressions and introduce bias.
